# Hive guide

Quick start guide for new users working with Hive partitioned data in R or Python.

The example data are generated by running a container, so you will need Podman or Docker installed.

## Files

### Generate example data

* `generate_test_data.R` standalone script in `R` folder to make some sample data, which is also accessed from the container
* `generate_test_data_2.R` standalone script in `R` folder to make some sample data with persistent cash balances but no parallel processing. Can change Dockerfile to use this in the container alternatively
* `Dockerfile` instruction set for building the data generator container
* `postal_districts.csv` CSV file in data-input folder containing UK postal districts, used to sample from to generate customer postal_district in the sample data. Accessed by the data generation script and copied into the container
* `DataZone2011lookup_2024-12-16.csv` CSV file in data-input folder containing list of data zones. These are a Scottish administrative designation. Accessed by the data generation script and copied into the container. Available from [statistics.gov.scot](https://statistics.gov.scot/data/data-zone-lookup)
* LSOA - coming soon!


To create the data in a container using Podman or Docker:

1. Build the container `podman build --platform linux/amd64 -t demo_data .`
1. Run the container `podman run --name demo_data demo_data`
   1. To opt into parallel processing, do `podman run --name demo_data -e PARALLEL_WORKERS=n demo_data` where `n` is the number of cores to use
1. Fetch the sample data from the container with: `podman cp demo_data:data-output/test_data/ data-output/`

> [!CAUTION]
> When running the container with parallelisation be sensible with the number of workers. The program will crash if you provide more than can be used, surfacing an error starting with `MultisessionFuture (future_lapply-6) failed to receive message results from cluster RichSOCKnode`. If this happens, reduce the number of workers and try again.

### Hive examples

* `R_hive_example.qmd` quarto doc with R code chunks
* `R_hive_example.md` *read this file in Github* for the worked examples
* python example - WIP
